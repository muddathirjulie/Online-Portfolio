          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p class="bio">
            Hello, I am Muddathir, a dedicated Junior Software Engineer and Data
            Analyst. Welcome to my digital portfolio, where I aim to create
            sophisticated solutions to intricate challenges and explore the
            limitless potential of technology.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Information
            Technology degree, majoring in Software Engineering from Eduvos,
            which gave me a strong foundation in software development
            methodologies, algorithms, and data structures. During my studies, I
            engaged in various projects, from creating dynamic web and mobile
            applications to solving complex algorithmic problems, deepening my
            technical expertise and igniting my passion for technology.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I gained valuable experience as a Full Stack Developer Intern at
            Digital2DNA from February to August 2023, where I honed my skills in
            both front-end and back-end development. In November 2023, I joined
            Creed Living Pty (Ltd) as a Data Analyst on a one-year contract,
            where I leveraged my analytical skills to extract insights and drive
            data-informed decisions. As of November 2024, I am now a permanent
            team member at Creed Living, where I also work on managing and
            optimizing the company's website for performance and user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            In addition to my Software Engineering background, I bring a robust
            set of Data Analysis skills to the table. I am proficient in
            utilizing various data analytics tools and methodologies to extract
            actionable insights and drive informed decision-making. My ability
            to bridge the gap between Software Development and Data Analysis
            enables me to tackle challenges from multiple angles, ensuring
            comprehensive and effective solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I excel in dynamic, collaborative environments where creativity and
            teamwork are valued. I am continually exploring new technologies and
            frameworks, always seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and
            skill set. Whether working with a team to brainstorm solutions or
            coding independently, I tackle every challenge with enthusiasm and a
            commitment to learning and growth.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about
            community engagement and contributing to open-source projects. I
            believe in the transformative power of technology to drive positive
            change and am eager to be involved in initiatives that make a
            meaningful impact.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Let's connect and discover how we can collaborate to shape the
            future of technology together!
