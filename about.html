          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p class="bio-about">
            Hello, I am Muddathir, a dedicated Junior Software Engineer and Data
            Analyst. Welcome to my digital portfolio, where I aim to create
            sophisticated solutions to intricate challenges and explore the
            limitless potential of technology.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="bio">
            By obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree
            with a major in Software Engineering from Eduvos, I have developed a
            solid foundation in software development methodologies, algorithms,
            and data structures. My academic journey allowed me to engage in a
            variety of projects, from creating dynamic web applications to
            solving complex algorithmic problems. These experiences have not
            only deepened my technical expertise but also ignited my passion for
            technology.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="bio">
            I gained valuable experience as a Full Stack Developer Intern at
            Digital2DNA from February to August 2023, where I honed my skills in
            both front-end and back-end development. Currently, I am working as
            a Data Analyst at Creed Living Pty Ltd, where I leverage my
            analytical skills to extract insights and drive data-informed
            decisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="bio">
            In addition to my Software Engineering background, I bring a robust
            set of Data Analysis skills to the table. I am proficient in
            utilizing various data analytics tools and methodologies to extract
            actionable insights and drive informed decision-making. My ability
            to bridge the gap between Software Development and Data Analysis
            enables me to tackle challenges from multiple angles, ensuring
            comprehensive and effective solutions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="bio">
            I excel in dynamic, collaborative environments where creativity and
            teamwork are valued. I am continually exploring new technologies and
            frameworks, always seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and
            skill set. Whether working with a team to brainstorm solutions or
            coding independently, I tackle every challenge with enthusiasm and a
            commitment to learning and growth.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="bio">
            Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about
            community engagement and contributing to open-source projects. I
            believe in the transformative power of technology to drive positive
            change and am eager to be involved in initiatives that make a
            meaningful impact.
